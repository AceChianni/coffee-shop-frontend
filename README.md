## Design Process
The design process focused on creating a user-friendly interface for managing shopping cart items and completing a purchase. The following steps were followed:
1. **Research and Planning**: Understanding user needs for simplicity and clarity in cart management.
2. **Wireframing**: Initial layouts were sketched to organize page elements effectively.
3. **High-Fidelity Mockups**: Detailed designs were created to finalize the layout, color schemes, and typography.
4. **Development**: Components were built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive design.

## Future Goals
- **Payment Integration**: Add secure payment gateways for a complete e-commerce experience.
- **User Accounts**: Enable users to save their cart, view order history, and manage profiles.
- **Animations**: Add subtle animations for hover states and transitions to improve user engagement.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Implement ARIA labels and screen reader testing for improved usability.
- **Search and Filtering**: Expand product browsing with advanced search and filtering options.

## Splash Page Design
The splash page introduces the application with:
- A prominent **hero image** that sets the tone for the e-commerce experience.
- A **call-to-action button** designed to guide users toward cart and checkout functionalities.
- Minimalist text overlays to reduce cognitive load.

## Color Scheme
The color palette reflects a modern and welcoming design:
- **Primary Color:** `#4CAF50` (Green) - Used for buttons and CTAs.
- **Secondary Color:** `#FF7043` (Orange) - Used for highlights and accents.
- **Background Color:** `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray) - Creates a clean and neutral canvas.
- **Text Color:** `#333333` (Dark Gray) - Ensures readability across all screens.

## Font Choices
The application uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for a polished and professional look:
- **Primary Font:** `Roboto` - A modern sans-serif font for headings and body text.
- **Fallback Fonts:** `Arial, sans-serif` for compatibility.

---

## Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive, ensuring usability across devices:
- **Mobile-First Design:** All components adapt to smaller screens seamlessly.
- **Flexbox Layouts:** Ensure elements are aligned dynamically, regardless of screen size.
- **Breakpoints:** Adjust layouts and font sizes for improved readability and functionality on tablets and desktops.

---

## Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Interactive elements (buttons, forms) are accessible via the keyboard.
